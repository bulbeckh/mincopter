TODO
- Understand full AP_AHRS and InertialNav, and Sensor variables

**Issues**
1. position error is growing - doesn't look like it's incorporating the GPS or barometer measurements into the inav
2. No min_climb_rate or max_climb_rate set in controller (this should be done by planner)
3. 




-> add another long term item - visualisation of simulation using things like blender

1. 1hr state writeup
2. 1hr controller/planner writeup

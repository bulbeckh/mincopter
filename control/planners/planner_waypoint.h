// Waypoint Implementation of Planner

/* The waypoint planner should start in a land state and then fly to each waypoint and the end in a land state.
 *
 *
 * METHOD
 * 
 * 1. Check failsafe and fence.
 *
 * 2. Check if criteria is met to move to next state (i.e. from LAND to first WP or from 4th WP to 5th WP).
 *
 * 3. Use planner to determine control inputs/targets.
 *
 *
 *
 * planner_waypoint is responsible for generating the following control inputs to the controller
 *
 *
 * - control_pitch
 * - control_roll
 * - control_yaw
 * - a desired altitude (from wp_nav.get_desired_alt)
 * - a descent velocity (from wp_nav.get_descent_velocity)
 * - a climb velocity (from wp_nav.get_climb_velocity)
 *
 * TODO I don't actually think yaw is even used in the autonomous modes
 *
 * Planner follows this loop:
 *
 * - update_nav_mode (called by scheduler)
 *   - update_wpnav
 *   	 - advance_target_along_track
 *   	   - (sets wp_nav._target variable which is used in get_desired_alt)
 *   	 - get_loiter_acceleration_to_lean_angles
 *   - update_loiter
 *   	 - (four steps)
 *   	 - get_loiter_acceleration_to_lean_angles
 * 
 *

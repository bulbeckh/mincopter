// Waypoint Implementation of Planner

/* The waypoint planner should start in a land state and then fly to each waypoint and the end in a land state.
 *
 *
 * ## Flight States
 * FS_TAKEOFF  - Planner begins in this state. Carefully tuned motor gains.
 * FS_WAYPOINT - Navigation between waypoints. Standard flight mode.
 * FS_LOITER   - Stationary mode for being stationary in air.
 * FS_LAND     - Prepare for landing. Slower descent speed and checks for ground.
 *
 * ## Motor States
 * ARMED    - Can send outputs to motors.
 * DISARMED - Cannot send outputs to motors.
 *
 * ## Sensor States
 * CLEAN    - All sensors have valid readings and can be trusted.
 * DIRTY    - At least one sensor is not working and has been broken for a minimum threshold time.
 *
 * planner_waypoint is responsible for generating the following control inputs to the controller
 *
 * - control_pitch. 
 * - control_roll
 * - control_yaw
 * - a desired altitude (from wp_nav.get_desired_alt)
 * - a descent velocity (from wp_nav.get_descent_velocity)
 * - a climb velocity (from wp_nav.get_climb_velocity)
 *
 * TODO I don't actually think yaw is even used in the autonomous modes
 *
 * Planner follows this loop:
 *
 * - update_nav_mode (called by scheduler)
 *   - update_wpnav
 *   	 - advance_target_along_track
 *   	   - (sets wp_nav._target variable which is used in get_desired_alt)
 *   	 - get_loiter_acceleration_to_lean_angles
 *   - update_loiter
 *   	 - (four steps)
 *   	 - get_loiter_acceleration_to_lean_angles
 * 
 * TODO A lot of the functionality specified in this base class needs to be hoisted to the parent class - planner.h
 *
